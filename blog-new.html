                                <p> Apple is said to be preparing for its next generation of ARM chips. According to
                                    reports, the 2022
                                    MacBook Air could be powered by the M2 chip. Apple is also working on an improved
                                    version of its M1
                                    processor, the M1X that can equip the new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The Apple M1 chip was built using TSMC’s 5nm process node. However, as per the
                                    report, the alleged M2
                                    chip is expected to be produced using TSMC’s 4nm processor note. The 4 nm process
                                    node means the
                                    upcoming processor will be even more power-efficient and powerful compared to its
                                    predecessor.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The M2 chip is expected to feature a total of eight cores that include four
                                    high-performance cores and
                                    four energy-efficient cores. The processor is also speculated to feature improved
                                    graphics cores.

                                    Regardless of the size of their nodes, the Apple M2 and M1X will have the same
                                    number of cores in their
                                    CPU part, i.e. 10. On the graphics side, some rumors point to the presence of 32
                                    cores for the Apple
                                    M1X, which the Apple M2 should contain a lower number.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The company is expected to launch the M1X processor with its 2021 lineup of Apple
                                    MacBook Pro.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Apple is also expected to launch its iPhone 13 models this fall, followed by a
                                    redesigned MacBook Air
                                    next year. A report this week claimed that the 2022 MacBook Pro 14 and 16 inches
                                    have finally entered
                                    mass production and are expected to launch later this year as part of Apple's busy
                                    fall season.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The pandemic delayed the launch of the iPhone 12 to October, but it's expected that
                                    Apple will return to
                                    their usual September launch date for the iPhone 13. According to leaks, there are
                                    likely to be four
                                    different colour options for the iPhone 13 Pro, which are black, silver, rose gold,
                                    and sunset gold.
