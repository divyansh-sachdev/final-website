            <b>Grand Theft Auto-6 (GTA-VI)</b> 
           <p> GTA 6 is quite the inevitability - despite the fact that developer Rockstar Games hasn't officially announced it yet. GTA 5, along with its online multiplayer component GTA Online, are one of the most-played and most-purchased games of all time, which means a sequel is quite the sure-bet.
<rb><br>
            According to a Kotaku report, "a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series," is early in development as of April 2020. That report also suggested we can expect to see a smaller launch, with the game expanded through updates in the manner of an MMO or GTA Online. 
<br><br>          
            The development timing means expecting the game to be a PS5 and Xbox Series X title is a sure bet, and the release of a remastered GTA 5 for PS5 in 2021 suggests we could be waiting quite a while for a new GTA title.
<br><br>  
            Keep reading for all GTA 6 rumors circulating so far.
