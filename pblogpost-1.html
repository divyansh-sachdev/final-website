                <b>Apple Macbook M2</b>
            <p> Apple is said to be preparing for its next generation of ARM chips. According to reports, the 2022
                MacBook Air could be powered by the M2 chip. Apple is also working on an improved version of its M1
                processor, the M1X that can equip the new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro.
                <br><br>
                The Apple M1 chip was built using TSMC’s 5nm process node. However, as per the report, the alleged M2
                chip is expected to be produced using TSMC’s 4nm processor note. The 4 nm process node means the
                upcoming processor will be even more power-efficient and powerful compared to its predecessor.
                <br><br>
                The M2 chip is expected to feature a total of eight cores that include four high-performance cores and
                four energy-efficient cores. The processor is also speculated to feature improved graphics cores.

                Regardless of the size of their nodes, the Apple M2 and M1X will have the same number of cores in their
                CPU part, i.e. 10. On the graphics side, some rumors point to the presence of 32 cores for the Apple
                M1X, which the Apple M2 should contain a lower number.
                <br><br>
                The company is expected to launch the M1X processor with its 2021 lineup of Apple MacBook Pro.
                <br><br>
                Apple is also expected to launch its iPhone 13 models this fall, followed by a redesigned MacBook Air
                next year. A report this week claimed that the 2022 MacBook Pro 14 and 16 inches have finally entered
                mass production and are expected to launch later this year as part of Apple's busy fall season.
                <br><br>
                The pandemic delayed the launch of the iPhone 12 to October, but it's expected that Apple will return to
                their usual September launch date for the iPhone 13. According to leaks, there are likely to be four
                different colour options for the iPhone 13 Pro, which are black, silver, rose gold, and sunset gold.
